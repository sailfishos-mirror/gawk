   empty sparse file whose size is a multiple of the system page
   size.  If file argument is NULL, fall back on standard memory
   allocator: pma_malloc passes the buck to ordinary malloc, pma_free
   calls ordinary free, etc.  In fallback-to-standard-malloc mode,
   only pma_malloc/calloc/realloc/free may be used; other functions
   such as pma_get/set_root must not be used.  The implementation may
